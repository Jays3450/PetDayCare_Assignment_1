# Pet Daycare Onboarding Optimization - Initial Meeting Prep

##  Context
After initial interviews with the Pet Daycare stakeholders, we have gathered key issues from three perspectives:

- **Business Owners**: New employee onboarding takes long time i.e., of at least 3 months.
- **Employees**: Client onboarding process is not consistent and is complicated.
- **Customers**: The onboarding experience is confusing and hard to follow.

---

##  Assumptions

Before the client meeting, we assume the following:
- There is **no standardized onboarding process** for clients or employees.
- Respective documentation and training materials are either **minimal or outdated**.
- Different employees follow **informal procedures**, leading to inconsistency.
- Clients interact via **in-person, phone, or online**, but its not recorded or noted.
- The business does not have a **centralized system or portal** for onboarding.

---

##  Broken Down Requirements (Initial)

### 1. **Streamline Employee Onboarding**
- Develop and maintain comprehensive Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)
- Design structured training plans with defined checklists and timelines
- Aim to significantly reduce the onboarding duration from the current 3-month average

### 2. **Optimize Client Onboarding Experience**
- Implement a consistent onboarding workflow to be followed by all employees
- Define and document the critical stages of client intake (e.g., registration, pet profile setup, vaccination verification, and payment)
- Enhance client understanding through clearly communicated instructions and accessible forms (both digital and physical)

### 3. **Implement Supportive Internal Systems**
- Develop a centralized internal dashboard to oversee and track client onboarding activities
- Create standardized templates and forms to ensure procedural consistency across staff
- Provide customers with well-structured resources such as a website section, FAQs, and a guided intake form

### 4. **Introduce Feedback Mechanisms**
- Implement regular feedback loops for both staff and clients to continuously improve the onboarding process
- Use simple surveys, follow-up emails, or internal check-ins to gather insights

##  Key Clarifying Questions

###  For Business Stakeholders (Owners/Management):
- Can you walk us through the current process of onboarding a new **employee** from start to finish?
- What specific training materials or resources are provided to new hires?
- Are there any documented procedures, and how consistently are they followed?
- What are the biggest challenges or delays youâ€™ve noticed during the onboarding period?
- Are any **KPIs** or success metrics tracked (e.g., time-to-productivity, retention, feedback)?
- Have any past attempts been made to improve the onboarding experience?

###  For Employees:
- How do you currently handle the onboarding of a new **client**? Are there any required steps or is it handled ad hoc?
- What systems or tools do you rely on when onboarding clients (e.g., spreadsheets, software, checklists)?
- Do you feel adequately trained and equipped to handle client onboarding consistently?
- What are the most common bottlenecks or pain points you experience in the process?
- In your opinion, what could be improved to make the process smoother and more consistent?

###  For Customers (via surveys, interviews, or feedback forms):
- At what point in the onboarding journey did you feel confused or unsure of the next steps?
- Were the expectations and requirements (e.g., forms, pet info, vaccinations) clearly communicated?
- Did you receive timely updates and support throughout the onboarding experience?
- Was the onboarding experience consistent regardless of which staff member you interacted with?
- What could we have done differently to make the onboarding experience better for you and your pet?

##  Follow-Up Questions (Based on Current Info)
- Are there any existing documents, tools, or systems we can review before redesigning the process (e.g., SOPs, checklists, forms)?
- What are the **common errors or frustrations** staff encounter during employee and client onboarding?
- Is there a **single point of accountability** or ownership for onboarding (either employee or client)? If not, how is it currently managed?
- How is onboarding performance currently evaluated, if at all? Are there any feedback loops in place?
- What is the preferred **communication channel** for interacting with clients during onboarding (e.g., mobile app, SMS, phone, email, paper forms)?
- Are there any **seasonal trends** or time-based onboarding spikes we should be aware of (e.g., holidays, school breaks)?
- Have there been any **customer complaints** or recurring feedback themes specifically related to onboarding?
- Is there any vision or **long-term goal** for the onboarding experience (e.g., full digitization, self-service portals)?
- What kind of **security, consent, or compliance requirements** must be followed when onboarding clients and collecting pet-related or personal data?
- Would the team be open to **piloting a revised onboarding process** with a small group of clients or employees before a full rollout?

##  Preliminary Task List (Name Only)

1. Audit existing employee onboarding documentation and training materials  
2. Conduct interviews with key staff across roles (management, employees)  
3. Map the current end-to-end client onboarding process  
4. Identify bottlenecks, redundancies, and inconsistencies in both onboarding workflows  
5. Design a standardized and unified client intake checklist  
6. Develop a structured, role-specific employee training and onboarding plan  
7. Create low-fidelity wireframes or mockups for a centralized onboarding dashboard or portal  
8. Draft client-facing materials (e.g., intake forms, welcome packets, FAQ content)  
9. Pilot the updated process with a small group of employees and clients  
10. Gather feedback, measure effectiveness, and iterate on improvements
